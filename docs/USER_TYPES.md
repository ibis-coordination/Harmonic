# User Types

This document describes the three user types in Harmonic and their roles in the system.

## Overview

| Type | Has OAuth | Has Parent | Purpose |
|------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `person` | Yes | No | Regular human users who authenticate via OAuth |
| `subagent` | No | Yes (required) | AI agents or automated users managed by a parent |
| `trustee` | No | No | Synthetic users representing studios or delegation relationships |

## User Type Details

### Person

A **person** is a regular human user who authenticates via OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.).

**Characteristics:**
- Has one or more `OauthIdentity` records linking them to external providers
- Cannot have a `parent_id` (validation enforced)
- Can create and manage subagent users
- Can be granted representative permissions to act on behalf of studios

**Created via:** OAuth authentication flow in `OauthIdentity.find_or_create_from_auth`

### Subagent

A **subagent** is an automated user (typically an AI agent) that operates under the authority of a parent person user.

**Characteristics:**
- Must have a `parent_id` pointing to a person user (validation enforced)
- Cannot authenticate directly via OAuth
- Authenticates via API tokens generated by their parent
- Can be impersonated by their parent user
- Parent can add subagent to studios where parent has invite permission

**Created via:**
- API: `POST /api/v1/users` (creates subagent for authenticated user)
- Service: `ApiHelper#create_subagent`

**Impersonation:** A parent can impersonate their subagent via `User#can_impersonate?`. When impersonating:
- `current_user` returns the subagent
- Actions are attributed to the subagent
- Parent can stop impersonation at any time

### Trustee

A **trustee** is a synthetic user that enables collective agency. Trustees don't represent individual humans—they represent studios or delegation relationships.

**Characteristics:**
- Created automatically (never by users directly)
- Has a generated email like `{uuid}@not-a-real-email.com`
- Cannot have a `parent_id`
- Cannot be a member of the main studio (validation enforced)
- Cannot be the creator of content (validation enforced)

**Two types of trustees:**

1. **Studio Trustee**: Every studio automatically creates a trustee user via `Studio#create_trustee!`. This trustee represents the studio as a unified entity.
   - `Studio.trustee_user` points to this user
   - `User#studio_trustee?` returns true
   - `User#trustee_studio` returns the associated studio

2. **Delegation Trustee**: Created by `TrusteePermission` to represent a delegation relationship between users. (Note: This feature is scaffolded but not yet used in production.)

## Authorization Methods

### `User#can_impersonate?(user)`

Returns true if this user can act as another user:
- Parent can impersonate their non-archived subagent
- Representative can impersonate a studio's trustee user (via `can_represent?`)

### `User#can_represent?(studio_or_user)`

Returns true if this user can act on behalf of a studio:
- Trustee user can represent their own studio
- Studio member with `representative` role can represent
- Studio member can represent if `studio.any_member_can_represent?` is true

### `User#can_edit?(user)`

Returns true if this user can modify another user's profile:
- Users can edit themselves
- Parents can edit their subagents

### `User#can_add_subagent_to_studio?(subagent, studio)`

Returns true if this user can add a subagent to a studio:
- Must be the subagent's parent
- Must have invite permission in the studio

## Validation Rules

| Trustee cannot be member of main studio | `StudioUser#trustee_users_not_member_of_main_studio` |
| Trustee cannot create content | `ApplicationRecord#creator_is_not_trustee` |
