* Converge on consensus using Decisions
* Initiate group action using Commitments

# Constraints to be aware of

Harmonic Team is intentionally designed to encourage proactive participation rather than passive dependence on software, which means that the app actually requires more effort to use than typical group collaboration software. While it may seem counterintuitive, this actually makes coordination faster, easier, and more consistent.

The design of Harmonic Team intentionally follows several deliberate design constraints that might be surprising for new users of the app. We will explain them here so that you are not confused as you use the app.

These design constraints are:

1. No discussion features (comments, chat, direct messages, etc.)
2. No notifications
3. No text search

## What features to use instead

Instead of the features listed above, use the following features.

### 1. Bidirectional Links

Instead of adding comments to items, make use of __bidirectional links__ between items. Notes, Decision, and Commitments all have a description field in which you can link to other items within the studio. These links automatically show up as backlinks on the pages of the linked items, allowing everyone to easily see and navigate between connected items. There's also a [Backlinks](<%= studio.url %>/backlinks) page where you can see a list of connected items.

### 2. Cycles

Instead of relying on notifications to tell you about updates as they happen, make use of __cycles__, which are time units like days, weeks, and months. On the [Cycles](<%= studio.url %>/cycles) page, you can look at the items that are active within a given cycle so that you can stay aware of what's happening and see how things are changing over time.

### 3. Scratchpad + Notes

Instead of using text search to find items later, make use of your [scratchpad](<%= studio.tenant.url %>/scratchpad) as a short-term memory aid to proactively track info that is relevant to you. And as a long-term memory aid, it is best practice to regularly summarize, synthesize, and index information by creating shared Notes that allow everyone to navigate the information more easily.

Once you have confirmed reading this note, visit the decision and commitment examples below.

* Decision <%= decision.shareable_link %>
* Commitment <%= commitment.shareable_link %>
