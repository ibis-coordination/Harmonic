# New Automation - <%= @current_superagent.name %>

Create a new automation by providing YAML configuration.

## Default Template

```yaml
<%= @yaml_source %>
```

## YAML Reference

### Trigger Types
- `event` - Trigger when a specific event occurs
- `schedule` - Trigger on a cron schedule
- `webhook` - Trigger via incoming webhook

### Schedule Trigger Configuration

For scheduled automations, use a cron expression:

```yaml
trigger:
  type: schedule
  cron: "0 9 * * *"            # Run at 9:00 AM daily
  timezone: "America/New_York"  # Optional, defaults to UTC
```

**Cron format:** `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `0 9 * * *` | Daily at 9:00 AM |
| `0 9 * * 1` | Every Monday at 9:00 AM |
| `0 9 1 * *` | First day of month at 9:00 AM |
| `0 9 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 9:00 AM |
| `0 */2 * * *` | Every 2 hours |

**Common timezones:** `UTC`, `America/New_York`, `America/Los_Angeles`, `Europe/London`, `Asia/Tokyo`

### Webhook Trigger Configuration

For webhook-triggered automations:

```yaml
trigger:
  type: webhook
```

After creation, you'll receive a unique webhook URL and secret for external systems to trigger this automation.

### Event Types
- `note.created` - A note was created
- `comment.created` - A comment was added
- `reply.created` - A reply was added
- `decision.created` - A decision was created
- `commitment.created` - A commitment was created
- `commitment.critical_mass` - A commitment reached critical mass

### Action Types

Studio automations use `actions` (not `task`):

```yaml
actions:
  - type: webhook
    url: "https://example.com/webhook"
    method: POST
    payload:
      text: "{{subject.title}}"

  - type: internal_action
    action: create_note
    params:
      text: "Automated note"

  - type: trigger_agent
    agent_id: "abc123"
    task: "Review this content"
```

### Template Variables
- `{{event.type}}` - The event type
- `{{event.actor.name}}` - Name of the triggering user
- `{{subject.path}}` - URL path to the subject
- `{{subject.title}}` - Title of the subject
- `{{studio.handle}}` - Handle of the studio
