# New Note

Notes only require text content (markdown). Any links to other resources within the studio should include the full URL, not just the path.

## [Actions](<%= @current_studio.path %>/note/actions)

* [`create_note(text)`](<%= @current_studio.path %>/note/actions/create_note) to create a new note.
