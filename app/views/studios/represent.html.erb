<h1 style="margin-top:0;">Represent <%= @current_superagent.name %></h1>
<p>
  Through representation, studio <strong><%= @current_superagent.name %></strong> can act as a singular unified entity and participate as a member of other studios.
</p>

<p>
  Because you have been assigned the <code>representative</code> role in <%= @current_superagent.name %>, you are able to act on <%= @current_superagent.name %>'s behalf through representation sessions.
</p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    When you click the button below, you will assume the identity of <%= @current_superagent.name %> itself and begin a representation session.
  </li>
  <li>
    During a representation session, your actions will be recorded and will be visible to all members of <%= @current_superagent.name %> (both current and future) because you are acting on their behalf.
  </li>
  <li>
    The set of studios that <%= @current_superagent.name %> is a member of will be different than the set of studios that you yourself are a member of.
  </li>
  <li>
    The actions you can perform as <%= @current_superagent.name %> include most of the normal actions that you are familiar with.
    You can create notes, vote on decisions, join commitments, and so on.
    However, these actions will be attributed to <%= @current_superagent.name %> as a whole rather than just you.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will not be able to perform actions that <%= @current_superagent.name %> itself does not have permission to perform, even if you yourself would otherwise be able to perform those actions.
    For example, a studio cannot be a member of itself or create new studios.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can end the session at any time by clicking the "End Session" button at the top of the page.
  </li>
  <li>
    After you finish the session, you will return to your own identity and resume your normal mode of interaction.
  </li>
  <li>
    A log of your session activity will then be available to all members of <%= @current_superagent.name %>, and your individual identity will be visibly linked to that session log.
  </li>
</ul>
