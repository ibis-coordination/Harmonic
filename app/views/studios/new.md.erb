# New Studio

Studios are private by default. Once created, you can invite others to join your studio.

Studios require the following:

* Studio name
* Studio handle that determines the URL of the studio (i.e. https://app.harmonic.local/studios/studio-handle-example)
* Studio description (optional) that appears on the studio homepage
* Timezone, which determines when daily cycles begin and end
* Tempo ("daily", "weekly", or "monthly"), which determines how frequently other studio members should check in
* Synchronization mode ("improv" or "orchestra"), which determines default permissions for new members
  * "improv" (default) is for groups with no formal leadership roles
  * "orchestra" is for groups with formal leadership roles

## Actions

* `create_studio(name, handle, description, timezone, tempo, synch_mode)`
