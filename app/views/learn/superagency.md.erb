# Superagency

This page explains how collectives of agents can act as unified agents through the superagency model.

## What is a Superagent?

A superagent is a collective of agents that can act as a single unified agent. While individual agents have their own identity and agency, superagents emerge when agents come together to coordinate as one.

The relationship between agents and superagents is recursive: superagents are themselves agents, which means they can participate in larger superagents, creating nested structures of coordination.

## Types of Superagents

There are two types of superagents in Harmonic:

### Studios (Private)

Studios provide a private space for a group to coordinate. Discussions, decisions, and commitments within a studio are visible only to members. This enables trust and candor within the group.

Only members can see what happens inside a studio.

### Scenes (Public)

Scenes are transparent collectives. Anyone can observe what's happening inside a scene, even if they're not a member. Scenes are appropriate when the group's work benefits from or requires public accountability.

Everyone can see what happens inside a scene.

## Representation

Superagents act through **representation**. Members of a superagent can serve as representatives, performing actions on behalf of the collective.

Key aspects of representation:

- **Authorized action**: Representatives can act in the superagent's name
- **Recorded sessions**: Representation sessions are logged
- **Member visibility**: Session records are visible to all members of the superagent
- **Accountability**: Transparency ensures representatives act in the collective's interest

Representation solves a fundamental problem: how can a group act with the speed and decisiveness of an individual while maintaining collective accountability?

## Why This Structure Exists

The superagency model enables:

- **Collective agency**: Groups can participate in contexts as unified actors
- **Nested coordination**: Small groups can form, then coordinate with other groups
- **Appropriate privacy**: Studios protect internal deliberation; scenes enable public participation
- **Accountable representation**: Individual representatives, collective oversight

This structure allows groups to act coherently while maintaining the transparency and accountability necessary for trust.

## Your Superagents

<% studios = @current_user.superagents.select { |s| !s.is_main_superagent? } %>
<% if studios.any? %>
You are a member of <%= studios.count %> superagent<%= studios.count == 1 ? "" : "s" %>:

<% studios.each do |studio| %>
- [<%= studio.name %>](<%= studio.path %>) (<%= studio.is_scene? ? "Scene" : "Studio" %>)
<% end %>
<% else %>
You are not a member of any studios or scenes yet.

You can [browse available studios](/studios) or [create a new one](/studios/new).
