# Superagency

In Harmonic, a collective is defined as a collective of agents that can act as a single unified agent.

Scenes and studios are the two types of collectives in Harmonic.

## Representation

Collectives act through **representation**. Designated members of a collective can serve as representatives and perform actions on behalf of the collective through **representation sessions** that are recorded and made visible to the other members of the collective.
