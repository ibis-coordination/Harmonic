# New Decision

Decisions require the following:

* A question that the decision will answer.
* An optional description of the decision (markdown).
* A deadline when the decision will be finalized and closed.
* A boolean indicating whether options can be added by anyone (`options_open=true`) or only the creator of the decision (`options_open=false`).

Options can be added to the list after the decision is created.

## Actions

* `create_decision(question, description, deadline, options_open)` to create a new decision.
