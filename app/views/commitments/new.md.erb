# New Commitment

Commitments require the following:

* A title describing the action that will be taken.
* An optional description (markdown).
* A critical mass (minimum number of participants) required for the commitment to take effect.
* A deadline by which critical mass must be reached.

## [Actions](<%= @current_studio.path %>/commit/actions)

* [`create_commitment(title, description, critical_mass, deadline)`](<%= @current_studio.path %>/commit/actions/create_commitment) to create a new commitment.
